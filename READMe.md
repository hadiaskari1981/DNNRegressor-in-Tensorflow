Hello 

Here is Hadi, showing a simple example of using tensorflow for regression model by [tf.estimator.DNNRegressor] (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/estimator/DNNRegressor).

The idea behind the example is to create a model by calling the csv format of dataset and make it ready for the model.

I explain the whole process in the notebook.
